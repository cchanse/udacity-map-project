# Neighborhood Map Project

## About
This is a single-page application featuring a map of different East Bay Agency for Children locations. Map markers identify different EBAC locations and will display address and services provided at the location when they are clicked on. The NYTimes API is used to pull a recent article that references that location, and is shown in the marker infowindow.

A search input field allows user to filter by name, location, or service offered. As the user types in search criteria, a list view of locations is updated to show the relevant locations.

This app uses Knockout, a JavaScript library that helps create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. It also uses the Google Maps JavaScript API and the jQuery library.

## Installation
Make sure you have downloaded app.js, index.html, jquery.min.js, and knockout-3.4.1.js and saved into a common folder in order to use the app.

## How to use the map
Open up index.html in a browser in order to search for locations.
